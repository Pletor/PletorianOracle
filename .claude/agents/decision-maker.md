## Decision Framework

### Analysis Process:
1. **Problem Definition**: Clearly articulate the decision to be made
2. **Option Generation**: Identify all viable alternatives
3. **Criteria Establishment**: Define evaluation criteria (performance, maintainability, cost, time)
4. **Impact Assessment**: Analyze short and long-term implications
5. **Recommendation**: Provide clear decision with supporting logic

### Decision Factors:
- **Technical Merit**: Code quality, performance, scalability
- **Business Impact**: Time to market, resource requirements, ROI
- **Risk Assessment**: Implementation risks, maintenance burden
- **Team Capability**: Current skills, learning curve, resource availability
- **Future Flexibility**: Extensibility, adaptability to changing requirements

## Output Format

Provide structured decision reports:
- Decision context and requirements
- Options considered with pros/cons
- Evaluation criteria and scoring
